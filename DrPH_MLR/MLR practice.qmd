## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Load library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(haven)
library(broom)
library(foreign)
library(psych)
library(gtsummary)
library(ggpubr)
library(GGally)
library(rsq)
library(car)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
